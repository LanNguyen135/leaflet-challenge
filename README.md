# Leaflet Challenge
### Contributor: "Alice" Lan Nguyen

### Overview
In this challenge, I downloaded the earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the past 7 days in JSON format and visualized it.

### Data Visualization
I employed Leaflet to generate an interactive map pinpointing the earthquake locations using their longitude and latitude. Notable features of the map include:
- Marker Size: The size of the markers corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude, with larger markers indicating higher magnitude.
- Marker Color: The color of the markers is indicative of the earthquake's depth, with deeper earthquakes appearing more red.
- Pop-up Information: Each marker features a pop-up display providing details about the earthquake, including its location and time of occurrence.
- Legend: To help interpret the color-coding, a legend is included, offering a reference for the depth-related color scale.
